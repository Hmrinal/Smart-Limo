# Smart-Limo

This is not the first time that 'smart' vehicles have been used to improve emergency services, with tiny smart cars in Sydney being used to navigate traffic easily and get paramedics on the scene quicker. Likewise, digital technology is revolutionising the medical sector everywhere we turn. The Smart Limo epitomise how technology can change the way health professionals access and manage vital information.

This is a project in which especially designed cars are been used in emergency services. We have attached sensors on each side of the vehicle. When the car gets bumped in by some vehicle or other object, a signal is transmitted to nearby hospital. The alert message can be stopped as per the wish of user; like in case the collision is minor. After the message is received by the hospital an ambulance can be sent at the accident spot. This can be done by tracking the location through GPS system. This step is taken to redefine the boundaries of emergency healthcare and help professionals provide better care than ever.
